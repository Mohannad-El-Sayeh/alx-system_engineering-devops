## In this project at ALX, I learned the basics of the shell and applied it.
I've learned & applied the following concepts:
* What is "The Shell"?
* Shell Navigation
* Looking Around The Files
* A Tour into the files of the system
* Manipulating Files
* Working with commands (type, man, help, which, etc..)
* How to read man pages
* What is LTS

And I'm going to continue my ALX Journey and learn SE.
